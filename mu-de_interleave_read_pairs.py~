# This script is designed to split an interleave fastq that was created by the dmwelch lab from  #
# what was once a paired read file. I can't find the pairs and this is a good python exercise for#
# a rainy monday morning. 

## THIS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.. PLAY IF YOU LIKE.

import sys
from Bio import SeqIO
import gzip 

infastq = gzip.open(sys.argv[1], 'rU') # read in the fastq file


## First we need to create a list of headers that we can search for in order to parse throught the file as a 
## SeqIO object.  
for line in infastq:
    x = line.strip().split("\t")
    if ">" in x[0]:
        header = x[0:8]
        if int(header[7]) == 2:
            print (header, x[n+1])
        else:
            print ("something is wrong")
    n += 1
